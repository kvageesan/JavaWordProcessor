# JavaWordProcessor
Word processor reads a file content from .doc, .docx and text file. It returns the largest word and it's transpose from the file.

To keep simplicity for the project and the time, I haven't added much of the functionalities.
Trying to list down some improvements that I will do on the existing project in future:

## Execution instruction

There are two ways you can execute this file in your machine. 
  -  One way is to download WordReader.jar from GitHub to your local machine. You only need this jar file and do not need any other files from GitHub.
    - Before executing the jar, please make sure you have the right version of java/jre installed. This program reqiures a minimum of java 1.8 and it works with more recent java version too (I tested in 15.0.2 as well as Java version 1.8)
    - To check java version on your machine, open command prompt(Windows) or Terminal(mac) and type java -version. If it says Java version 1.7 or below, Please update your java version. If it says Java version 1.8 or above, you are good to go. I will leave a section below on how to update your java version.
  -  If you have eclipse or other IDE in your, you can download this Java project from GitHub and Run the ReadFile.java as a java application. Please make sure you have JRE 1.8 and above set for this execution.

- Download the WordReader.jar into your local machine.
